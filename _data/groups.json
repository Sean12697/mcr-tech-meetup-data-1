    "description": "<p>IT Infrastructure and the move to cloud services are the essential backbone of all effective businesses. MIG (Manchester Infrastructure Group) was created so that professionals in this area can get to together and share ideas and thoughts on this ever evolving space!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This meet up is designed to be a learning platform&nbsp;to upskill the community, alongside being a networking opportunity for individuals who want to create a community outside of work; to bounce ideas, talk about the challenges they are facing, make friends&nbsp;and&nbsp;much&nbsp;more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is a place where the tech community can come to listen, learn, explore and connect. These events take place every month and bring some of the industry’s leading experts to the meetups to talk about their experience. These meet ups also provide a stage for those with something to share, or a seat for those with a hunger to learn and progress.&nbsp;You will take away hints and tips that you can take back to your teams, then tell us at the next meetup if it was successful.&nbsp;All this whilst&nbsp;making&nbsp;some friends along the way over Pizza and beer&nbsp;and/or virtually!</p>\n<p><br>We&nbsp;are always on the lookout for people to facilitate or present sessions, as well as businesses who wish to host - so if you are interested, get in touch!</p>",

We're very much open to people of all experience from beginner to expert as we offer a fair and open opportunity for those of all skill sets to experience something new, brush up on skills, or even learn a new approach from those around you.</p>\n<p>This isn't designed to be a super serious, heads down event. The flow is loose, collaboration is encouraged, as long as you feel like you've gained new knowledge then we're happy.</p>",

We all know that data has the potential to transform how projects, programmes and portfolios are delivered, but practical implementation constraints often prevent the full value from being realised. This meetup will explore some of the challenges at the intersection of data analysis and project, programme and portfolio management and discuss how practitioners are working to resolve them, underpinned by real world examples.</p> \n<p>We'll also explore how machine learning and AI can help to resolve some of the challenges at the intersection of project / programme management and big data.</p> \n<p>The NW Project Data Analytics Meetup expands the hugely successful London Project Data Analytics community across the country. </p> \n<p>Please check out our community site at <a href=\"http://projectdataanalytics.uk\" class=\"linkified\">http://projectdataanalytics.uk</a> . We are in the process of refreshing it but it will have details of events, community news, videos, slides, blogs and a series of resources on how to get started in project data analytics.</p>",

Given what's going on in the world right now, we have taken the decision to bring forward our plan to introduce Deliver Sessions in the Ether, an online meetup which we hope will reach a further audience as well as our regulars in Manchester!</p> \n<p>This event is using the <b>in the Ether</b> format, for more info or to find out how to run your own meet-up in the Ether please see <a href=\"http://intheether.xyz\">intheether.xyz</a></p> \n<p>We want to help create a great network of people who are there to learn from each other, share tips, learn about new tools, explore ideas and support each other in our aim to be great at what we do.</p> \n<p>Not sure if there's something for you? Perhaps 'project manager' or 'delivery-something' or 'Scrum Master' isn't your role? Maybe not but the techniques to manage projects, people, relationships and budgets are still relevant. Whatever your job title, come along and join this fast growing community.</p> \n<p>We are always looking for speakers, contact us at the meetup or on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeliverSessions\">@DeliverSessions</a></p> \n<p>See you soon!</p> \n<p>Matt, Zoe, Neil and Chris</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattthornhilluk?lang=en\">@mattthornhilluk</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZoeRigley\">@ZoeRigley </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/neil_vass\">@neil_vass</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BadlyDrawnBurns\"> @BadlyDrawnBurns</a></p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>",

You can make new contacts, organise collaborations, land yourself some freelance work, land yourself a job, hit on the next big idea or just have a drink before you go home.

We love sharing technical and marketing expertise to help others achieve what they intend through WordPress.</p>\n<p>We meet once per month, on the third Wednesday, in Manchester's Northern Quarter. We meet as a whole group, run breakout sessions to resolve small or complex problems to keep you moving, and encourage topical guest speakers. We welcome all interest whether you are a keen programmer, entrepreneur or hobby blogger wanting to maximise the potential of your WordPress blog.</p>\n<p>You'll find a route to continued discussion and support within the community in our Google group -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/manchester-wordpress-user-group\">https://groups.google.com/d/forum/manchester-wordpress-user-group</a>. <strong>Please post questions on the google group rather than on Meetup</strong>.</p>\n<p>All levels of experience welcome!

Patch:Manchester is about getting together, teaming up, and putting that right.</p>\n<p>Each month we will have one or more featured projects, with a regular project contributor around to onboard, introduce, and generally help contributors. We usually feature each project for 3 meetings, but you are welcome to continue contributing to the project in future months!</p>\n<p>Don't fancy what's been featured? Not to worry: you can either do your own thing, or if you don't know what to work on, we have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Open-Source/pages/20868363/Suggested_open-source_projects/\">list of suggested projects</a>, or simply ask around in the group!</p>\n<p>If you're a developer, designer, tester, UX, or want to give back to open source but you don't know how, come along and join in! It doesn't matter what your level of technical skills are, or if you've never contributed to the project before. Come along, say hello, and be made to feel welcome!</p>\n<p>Bring your laptop! :)</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(Please remember that we operate a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Open-Source/pages/20820585/Code_of_Conduct/\">code of conduct</a>)</p>",

    "description": "<p><span>DevOps Manchester is a community of like-minded individuals that get together and talk about DevOps, whether it’s technical or cultural and regardless of industry.</span><br></p>\n<p>The aim is to have 4 - 6 meetups per year with a flexible format of two 30 - 45 minutes talks, one technical and one not; Followed by the possibility of some lightning talks, panels, roundtables and networking time. </p>\n<p>Food and drink are provided, usually by the host or a sponsor.</p>\n<p><b>What we are not about</b></p>\n<p>Recruitment, vendor pitches &amp; knowledge declaration. </p>\n<p>The group will be a safe place to discuss experiences and ideas. With this in mind, we’d prefer no recruiters take part with the intent to source clients and that vendors don’t do pitches at our events. </p>\n<p>Sponsors are of course welcome, but the notoriety and thanks are what we can offer. </p>\n<p><b>Code of conduct</b></p>\n<p>TL;DR: Be nice, understanding and helpful.</p>\n<p>1. I am an attendee at DevOps Manchester, learning from and sharing with other DevOps Manchester attendees in an effort to better myself and my industry. I co-create the experience with fellow attendees. I am prepared to give my energy, presence and sensitivity to creating the best possible experience for myself and others.</p>\n<p>2. I am coming to DevOps Manchester to interact with people. I understand that imagery and language which is suggestive or derogatory will offend and make people uncomfortable. I also understand that people may have boundaries and sensibilities different from my own. I will accept without question when informed that something is offensive or unacceptable in the context of the DevOps Manchester event.</p>\n<p>3. I will never intentionally harass or offend another attendee regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, size, race or religion and will not abide another attendee being harassed or offended. If I am aware that anyone is uncomfortable or unsafe, I will notify those giving offence and the DevOps Manchester event organizers.</p>\n<p>4. If I am offended or harassed, I will inform people around me who make me feel safe and the event organizers. If I feel safe, at my discretion, I will inform those giving offence of the specific actions with the hope that the other party is well-intentioned and ignorant, but I am under no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p>5. I understand that people are different and I attempt to be forgiving of others actions at the level of their sincere intent, but my priority is protecting my safety and the safety of others. I will act without hesitation or reservation until there is no question of the safety of all parties.</p>\n<p>6. I trust the DevOps Manchester organizers and attendees will co-create the best possible experience for everyone involved, as I will. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. If I or any other attendee violates the code of conduct, I expect the DevOps Manchester organizers to protect the attendees by direct action, including expelling those in violation and contacting the proper authorities if required.</p>\n<p><b>Talk guidelines</b></p>\n<p>Talks that tell a story are often the most popular, so please share your experiences and encourage discussion. </p>\n<p>Further information can be found on: <br> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/\">http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devopsmanc\"> <br> </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devopsmanc\">https://twitter.com/devopsmanc</a> <br> </p>",

    "description": "<p><b>HER+Data MCR (\"Her plus Data Manchester\") is a community working to connect, inspire, support and empower the NW UK’s Women in Data! </b>We meet on the 2nd Thursday of each month. Event pages are created about 3-4 weeks in advance but future dates are scheduled on the <a href=\"https://technw.uk/calendar.html\">technwuk calendar</a>. <br></p>\n<p>HER+Data MCR is a Meetup group which brings together anyone who identifies as a woman and has a connection to data - whether they work with data, would like to work with data, and/or simply have an interest in data! The scope is intended to be broad to include as many women within STEM as possible while also maintaining a focus on the topic of data - we talk data science, analytics, research, visualisation, software, applications and experiences women share working in male dominated environments. We have members whose backgrounds range from academia to industry, students to CEOs, neuroscientists to idea implementers. We meet once a month (on the 2nd Thursday), provide ample time for networking, and showcase 2-4 women in data speakers who talk about their career paths, role models, challenges faced and data projects that they work on. We also conduct masterclasses a few times each year on topics such as CV writing, interviewing techniques and salary negotiation to empower women to progress in data roles. <br></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://herplusdata.org/\">HER+Data</a> is a space where everyone can share their stories and develop. We're volunteer driven so we keep our events simple and informal. There will be great content, laughter and a room full of data women from various backgrounds. So come along, ask questions, and get inspired! And if there are specific topics that you would like to see discussed then please let us know. We are always happy to explore new ideas and new collaborations. HER+Data was originally founded in Dublin, Ireland as XX+Data by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenchurch\">Karen Church</a> and the Manchester chapter was established by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachaelevelyn\">Rachael Ainsworth</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much to <a href=\"https://www.evolutionjobs.com/uk/\">Evolution Recruitment Solutions</a> for sponsoring our events! Evolution delivers IT and tech recruitment solutions for niche and volume contingent, retained search, RPO and contract assignments. Our specialist recruitment consultants partner with their clients to provide the best quality candidates for hard-to-fill roles. Using customer intelligence from the relationships we’ve developed, augmented with data from social media, events, networking, and advertisement responses, provides us with a detailed profile of the IT professionals our clients need. Evolution is different because we don’t just recruit in the IT and tech sectors, we are actively and consistently involved in the industries – including our involvement with HER + Data. We are committed to promoting equality and diversity within the IT and tech industries. 2019 statistics show that women make up only one-in-six tech specialists in the UK, Evolution is committed to improving these numbers and highlighting the importance of women working in IT and tech. <br></p>\n<p>We would also love to thank the <a href=\"https://software.ac.uk/\">Software Sustainability Institute</a> for sponsoring the cost of our Meetup page and to <a href=\"http://stickermule.com/supports/herdatamcr19-sponsorship\">Sticker Mule</a> for sponsoring our stickers! <br></p>\n<p>By joining our community, you are agree to abide by our <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/HER-Data-MCR/pages/28013678/Code_of_Conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a>. <br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Mission: To build a strong community to support, mentor and promote leadership and careers for women in technology in the North of the UK. Women in tech is a never-ending conversation. Does it swirl around a set of anxieties we share in our underrepresented gender — anxieties we might not even understand? More than ever, women in technology need to support each other. Encourage each other. Be each other’s cheerleaders, boosters and sponsors. Pipeline problems aren’t solved at the top, remember, but at the bottom. There’s a massive gender gap in the tech sector and it’s a fact we need to be aware of. <br>- The fact that women are under-represented – only 1 in 10 IT workers in the IT industry are women <br>- The fact that women are paid 16% less than their male counterparts doing the same job But is being aware enough? Absolutely NOT. However, being aware is definitely a starting point for us to change the face of technology. We want you all to think about what we, as a group and as individuals can do to eliminate this gap. Ambitions: <br>- Contribute to change the gender imbalance in the IT industry for the future <br>- Find professional fulfilment <br>- Inspire and persuade others to step up, achieve more, reach higher</p>\n<p> <br>We are here to: Connect the professional, creative, innovative and hard-working women to achieve their full potential</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<br>",

    "description": "<p>The worlds of hackers and journalists are coming together as reporting goes digital and Internet companies become media empires.</p>\n<p>Journalists call themselves \"hacks,\" someone who can churn out words in any situation. Hackers use the digital equivalent of duct tape to whip out code. Hacker-journalists try and bridge the two worlds.</p>\n<p>This group is to bring all these people together -- those who are working to help people make sense of their world. It's for hackers exploring technologies to filter and visualize information, and for journalists who use technology to find and tell stories. In the age of information overload, all their work has become even more crucial.</p>\n<p>This group aims to help members find inspiration and think in new directions, bringing together potential collaborators for projects and new ventures.</p>\n<p>Please also check out our blog at <a href=\"http://hackshackers.com/\"></a><a href=\"http://hackshackers.com/\"></a><a href=\"http://hackshackers.com/\"></a><a href=\"http://hackshackers.com/\"></a><a href=\"http://hackshackers.com/\">http://hackshackers.com</a></p>\n<p>Help us build the future of media!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Bringing #YouEqualTech to the North</p>\n<p>Spinks started the conversation on Diversity in Tech when we launched the tech industry’s first Women in Tech Survey, in partnership with Computer Weekly. Since then the conversation has evolved, moving away from diversity seen only through a gender lens; addressing the need for diverse tech teams and inclusive work places where people feel they fully belong. </p>\n<p>We believe in the power of community – #YouEqualTech started 2 years ago in London and is slowly becoming a leading community making change happen through their meetups and network. With over 3000 people in the group we felt it was time to take #YouEqualTech to the North and expand the reach and impact. </p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is to bring together people in technology, to continue this incredibly important conversation. Change doesn’t start top down, it has to happen at every level across every function. Community led initiatives are incredibly effective at having wide reaching results and helping to pave the way through learning, talking and hearing what about works/doesn’t work also having the opportunity to hear and see role models from under-represented groups in tech.</p>\n<p><span>The purpose of this meetup is to connect the technology and digital industry to the outside world!</span> <br></p>\n<p>We aim to:</p>\n<p>• Dispel myths and incorrect perceptions of what it’s like to work in tech and digital.</p>\n<p>• Educate and inform the various routes into technology and digital career</p>\n<p>• Work towards gender diversity in tech</p>\n<p>• Close the skills gap!</p>\n<p>Join this group if:</p>\n<p>• You work in technology or digital and are interested in working towards an inclusive and diverse industry</p>\n<p>• You do not work in a technical role but are interested in a possible career within the industry</p>\n<p>We will be holding regular meet up events and each one will aim to provide practical advice on driving diversity within the technology industry.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in being a speaker at one of our events please get in touch with lara.hanson@wearespinks.com&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also share ideas, initiatives and tips on our #YetNorth <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12211220/\">LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s super important to us that everyone feels welcome at #YETNorth events, so please familiarise yourselves with our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/You-Equal-Tech-North/pages/28531977/Code_of_Conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a><span>.</span></p>",

It takes a scientific approach, focusing on determining the what the biggest risks are, identifying assumptions being made and validating learning to ensure that the right product is being built.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Where can Lean Startup be applied?</b></p>\n<p>Lean Startup is usually associated with tech startups, but the methodologies can be applied to businesses and organisations of any size. Whether you are just starting out with a new idea or working in a large enterprise, we hope you will find value from our group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Why should you get involved?&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>You will learn how to apply the methodologies at your organisation and discover how you can dramatically derisk projects and products, and build solutions that people really need. Along the way you’ll meet some amazing people, take part in workshops and hear from some influential speakers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Who is behind Leanmanc?</b></p>\n<p>Leanmanc is brought to you by:</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Ben Aldred - cofounder of Manchester based LeanConf, Europe’s largest Lean Startup conference.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>James Lewis - Head of Product at Manchester based startup, DigitalBridge.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<br>\n<p>* The Lean Startup is a trademark and service mark owned by Eric Ries. *</p>",

We will also be looking at holding Meet-Ups that focus on Mental Health within Tech and providing resources and somewhere to talk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Techs and The City hopes to be a safe space for anyone within technology in Manchester to come to for advice on things like work, home, technology, even somewhere to live in the city.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\n<p>Everyone is welcome.</p>\n<p>Recruiters/Vendors/Suppliers are an important part of the tech ecosystem in Manchester, and we respect that you have a job to do and deserve to be involved in these events as well.

Gratuitously tapping people up for jobs/business will not be tolerated.&nbsp;</p>",

In doing so we'll benefit from the wisdom of the crowd and hopefully improve our understanding.</p>\n<p><span>Please note an in depth knowledge of patterns isn't required and all skill levels are welcome!&nbsp; A diverse range of perspectives is encouraged, however we'd recommend that attendees have studied the pattern that'll be discussed that week.</span></p>\n<p>Food and drink provided. 🙌</p>",

All this is bookended by the most informal and happy networking you will ever come across.</p>\n<p>There are three values that unite us: listening over shouting, saying hello to everyone, and being positively lovely (that's all about giving first, and treating people as people - not job titles).</p>\n<p>We're part of the larger community known as 'The Marketing Meetup', which has positively lovely events across the UK for astonishing marketeers. Podcasts, blog posts, our closed Facebook group and all our other events can be found at themarketingmeetup.com</p>\n<p>Anyone is welcome to come along, as you come to listen, are prepared to say hello and be positively lovely :).</p>\n<p>*For more about The Marketing Meetup and our global events, head to The Marketing Meetup.

Of particular interest to this group are practices and methods for improving the effectiveness of teams and organisations delivering complex services. Kanban, Lean, Agile, Rightshifting, Continuous Delivery and Systems Thinking are just some of the topics for discussion.</p>\n<p>Many of the practices we are expert in are traditionally associated with software development but we are here to help everyone adopt and adapt them to solve other workplace conundrums in our increasingly digitized, fast paced and shrinking world; how to collaborate, how to make sense of complex problems, how to deliver things quickly.</p>\n<p>So if you are in software delivery, service delivery, commerce, a start up, a community group, anything with a customer, come along to learn with us and share with us</p>\n<p>When: 1st Thursday of each month, 6:30pm onwards. We're normally finished for 8:30/9pm unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<p>Cost : All meetings are free and registration is required as the capacity of the venue is often limited.</p>\n<p>Our meetings are informal and friendly with plenty of opportunity for discussion and chat.</p>",

Each series is a primer course on topics such as Golang, Serverless, .net core and other tools / languages which we use within Infinity Works and would like to share with the community.</p>\n<p>Sessions are specifically aimed at professionals that wish to expand their current knowledge and skills in a few evening sessions spanning two to three weeks. Guest trainers will support lessons over a two-hour period for free, in a central Manchester location. There will be also opportunities for networking after and a possible drink or two.</p>\n<p>We will have to limit class sizes to around 20-30 members. Registering here in Meetup to sessions will allow you to express interest in attending and we will contact you with further details. Don't worry if a session is full, we will rerun any that are full.</p>\n<p>Code of Conduct</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinityworks/101-Sessions/master/codeofconduct.md\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinityworks/101-Sessions/master/codeofconduct.md</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

    "description": "<p><span>Hello and welcome to our Book Club.</span> <br></p>\n<p><span>Do you enjoy reading insightful and thought-provoking business books? Would you like to review and discuss them in a friendly, informal atmosphere? If so, join The Manchester Business Book Club - it's free.</span> <br></p>\n<p><b>Our aims are simple: identifying, reading and discussing the best business books available today.&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><span>We are interested in great ideas about business organisations, large and small, how they function and why they succeed or fail.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Book Club should not be viewed as a place for selling or self-promotion, nor is it focused on individual careers. &nbsp;It's about businesses, how we can understand them better and improve their performance (or at least avoid some of the pitfalls).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>We aim to meet once every 6 weeks, just enough time to source and read the next book. Venues will be in central Manchester and meetings scheduled for an early evening start (free refreshments will be available from 6pm, courtesy of our sponsors). &nbsp;Each event lasts approximately 60-80 minutes.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p><b>BOOK SELECTION</b></p>\n<p>The books are selected by the Meetup Organiser in collaboration with Club members and other stakeholders, including the Central Library. The selection criteria for books will be as follows:</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;General interest business topics (e.g. financial planning would be too specialised)</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Professionally published (i.e. excludes self-publishing)</p>\n<p>• Contemporary (editions up to 5 years old)</p>\n<p>• Receiving broadly good reviews and/or winning accolades <br></p>\n<p>• Diverse author perspectives (i.e. a mix of ages, genders, cultures, nationalities and business sectors) <br></p>\n<p><span>•&nbsp;</span><span>Not too expensive</span> <br></p>\n<p>•&nbsp;<span>Not too many pages</span></p>\n<p><span>• Plenty of copies available (both new and used). <br></span></p>\n<p><b>Manchester Central Library have promised to order multiple copies of our chosen books for lending to Club members. &nbsp;You can join the library&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/Join-City-Library\">here</a>.</b></p>\n<p><span>If you would like to propose a reading book for the Club (meeting the criteria above) please contact the Organiser. &nbsp;You may also give a 5-minute presentation on any favourite business book. &nbsp;Of course, selling is not permitted, either directly or indirectly.</span>&nbsp; <br></p>\n<p>Please note that self-help books about climbing the career ladder and achieving riches 'beyond your wildest dreams' do <b>not </b>feature on the MBBC book list. &nbsp;If you are interested in these aspects of personal development, there are plenty of other self-help groups and clubs in your local area.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p><b>READING &amp; THINKING</b></p>\n<p>When we discuss each book, consider the following:</p>\n<p><span>•&nbsp;Resonance: How does the content of the book compare with your own work experiences?</span> <br></p>\n<p>•&nbsp;Value: Will the book influence your future actions? &nbsp;If so, how?</p>\n<p>• Quality: Overall, how effective was the book's structure and writing style? <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p><b>THE CLUB ETHOS</b></p>\n<p>The Book Club is intended to be a friendly place for developing workplace skills and hearing alternative perspectives on the many challenges faced by businesses today.</p>\n<p>Together we can raise the profile of business thought leadership in Manchester.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p><b>FOLLOW</b></p>\n<p>Twitter: @MancBizBooks</p>",

Together.</p>\n<p>Why join&nbsp;<b>B.U.I.L.D</b>?</p>\n<p>If you are looking to participate in events like workshops, trainings, lectures, seminars, hackathons aiming to transform you and your business for success and you consider yourself a business B.U.I.L.D:er, it would be foolish of you not to join this group.</p>\n<p><b>A business B.U.I.L.D:er is:</b></p>\n<p>·&nbsp; anyone who wants to build a successful business;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp; somebody who has an entrepreneurial mindset = often drawn to opportunities, innovation, new value creation and willing to take risks</p>\n<p>·&nbsp; an employee curious about starting a business or wanting to apply entrepreneurial thinking at his/her workplace.</p>\n<p>·&nbsp; a smart manager or business owner looking for innovation ideas,</p>\n<p>·&nbsp; an edgy consultant, freelancer or solopreneur</p>\n<p>·&nbsp; a student or researcher with an entrepreneurship interest</p>\n<p>Do you see value and opportunities in networking and want business dreams to come true in mutually beneficial ways? Invest in yourself and a more entrepreneurial world today and come along!</p>\n<p><b>What is a B.U.I.L.D event?</b></p>\n<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events can be about sales, marketing, branding, customer engagement, self development, finance, law, growth hacking and any other topic which in one way or another can help businesses become more awesome.</p>\n<p><b>Become an event organizer</b></p>\n<p>•&nbsp;You can attend events and benefit from networking with likeminded. However,&nbsp;<b>your benefits can be massive if you organize these events yourself</b>. Events and Meetup groups are a great way to get:</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;connections</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;promote your services and expertise</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;goodwill&nbsp;</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;test ideas</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;feedback</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;referrals&nbsp;</p>\n<p>•&nbsp;introductions</p>\n<p>Being part of a bigger organization and group opens more doors than going about it alone. B.U.I.L.D exists in 11 cities in Europe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Running a successful Meetup-group also requires, much like a business, grit and a lot of time, dedication and effort. What if you could go in lean and test your session by organizing only one event?</p>\n<p>We at B.U.I.L.D give you a chance to organize just one event (or more in the future) under the B.U.I.L.D. brand with its existing members instead of starting your own Meetup group from scratch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/7/f/600_447214175.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><b>How to apply</b></p>\n<p>If you would like to promote your service by sharing your knowledge and expertise with other professionals and entrepreneurs with a workshop or get-together; apply to get your event published and promoted by contacting EntAnon's Community Manager Jenny via e-mail on jenny.bjorklof@entanon.com. You get support on how to organize great B.U.I.L.D events by experienced business event organizers.</p>\n<p>Please note: Free events = free support, paid events = agreed profit share on a case to case basis.</p>\n<p><b>The history of B.U.I.L.D</b></p>\n<p>B.U.I.L.D is a brand by EntAnon (short for Entrepreneurs Anonymous). In 2015 more than 30 thought provoking events were organized by EntAnon and B.U.I.L.D (that is at least one event every second week) engaging thousands of members. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The name Entrepreneurs Anonymous could stand for being addicted to Entrepreneurship and having an urgent need to get group support for it. But actually Entrepreneurs Anonymous is more about providing a safe place with like-minded people where entrepreneurship can be explored. Here Entrepreneurs-to-be and undercover entrepreneurs from corporates have been spotted too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs Anonymous events started in Dublin, Ireland in 2011 as accountability group by former students of an entrepreneurship course. The interest for the group grew and now social events with guest speakers are organized every last Tuesday of the month. With a membership increase by 10% each month it was quickly realized last Tuesday-events were simply just not enough for the Anonymous Entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;was set up to offer more opportunities for Entrepreneurs to learn from each other. So far&nbsp;B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events like the Gigonomy Panel discussion, Speed Business Networking and the Free Business Clinic have been organized. B.U.I.L.D also organizes former DDM events. These are events for people especially interested in Data Driven Marketing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>More about B.U.I.L.D and DDM Alliance</b></p>\n<p>EntAnon's brand&nbsp;​​B.U.I.L.D partnered&nbsp;​ with the former Data Driven Marketing Alliance (DDM). Future ​DDM&nbsp;​meetups and other events in Copenhagen, Berlin, Belgium, Dublin,&nbsp;Dusseldorf, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Netherlands, Paris,&nbsp;Stockholm, ​soon ​Milano​ and other parts of Europe will be organized together with B.U.I.L.D. DDM representatives​ can&nbsp;​set up online events​ ​(webinars and conferences) and&nbsp;use the B.U.I.L.D. groups around Europe ​as ​​a channel.&nbsp;If another B.U​.​I​.​L​.​D or EntAnon​ ​event is set on the same date the organizers agree​ ​on the next best date for the&nbsp;DDM&nbsp;Alliance event to take​ ​place.</p>",

These events take place every month and bring some of the industry’s leading experts to the meetups to talk about their experience. These meet ups also provide a stage for those with something to share, or a seat for those with a hunger to learn and progress. You will take away hints and tips that you can take back to your teams, then tell us at the next meetup if it was successful. All this whilst making some friends along the way over Pizza and beer and/or virtually!</p> We are always on the lookout for people to facilitate or present sessions, as well as businesses who wish to host - so if you are interested, get in touch!",

An employee that is looking to jump into entrepreneurship, but would prefer to buy a business as opposed to starting one from scratch?</p>\n<p>2. Have a relative or friend who wants to sell you their business, but you do not have the capital to transact?</p>\n<p>3. Already own business but organic growth is too slow and painful and you want a faster growth trajectory by buying out your competitor?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.perryanderson.global/events\">Testimonials from previous attendees</a></p>\n<p><b>The host of this event:</b></p>\n<p>Perry M. Anderson is a Private Equity investor and Oxford MBA, who founded a private equity firm in 2002. He lives between homes in London and Vancouver. Perry has taught this material to hundreds of people globally on how to buy and sell businesses for a living - without having to risk any of your own capital in order to transact. Recently he has published his book&nbsp;<i>\"Red to Black - The Art of Corporate Turnaround\".</i></p>\n<p><b>Perry Anderson:</b>&nbsp;\"I have completed over 30 investments in the past 19 years - all using my own capital. After 2 decades worth of experience in deal-making, I have come to realize that the capital to do deals does not have to come from your own pocket, as the alternative finance markets are awash with capital. I can show you how to access this!\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.perryanderson.global/about\">More about Perry Anderson</a></p>\n<p>So, what would you learn?</p>\n<p><b>How to source a business?</b>&nbsp;Without using Brokers or Intermediaries to have a constant flow of deals that fit your specific parameters and interests.</p>\n<p><b>How to structure a 'win-win' offer?</b>&nbsp;Deals only work when both parties gain. Using creative deal structures, Perry will show you how to get to a win-win.</p>\n<p><b>How to fund business for sale and close the deal?</b>&nbsp;Using private capital (from the alternative capital markets) and creative financing without the need to use any of your own personal capital.</p>\n<p><b>How to buy a profitable business for $1?</b>&nbsp;Perry recently acquired a profitable chain of well established retail stores for $1. The business was turning over $1.7M in&nbsp;consistent revenue.&nbsp;Mindset and structuring was key to this transaction Perry will show you&nbsp;<i>exactly</i>&nbsp;how this was done step-by-step. This deal structure can easily be copied and replicated - and is a simple deal structure to get a deal over the line quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>How to conduct due diligence and closing?</b>&nbsp;Legals and accounting are an integral part of any transaction. Perry will show you how to get this done efficiently and how to have the company pay for these expenses...not you!</p>\n<p><b>How to fix the company?</b>&nbsp;Whether a company is distressed or profitable, there will be areas of the business that need fixing. Perry has some really clever and proven tactics that you can implement immediately that will have a significant impact on the cash flow of the business.&nbsp;More urgently, when you cannot make payroll next week, what do you do? These are vital tactics for any down economic market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>How and when to use a Merger?</b>&nbsp;This is the fastest way to build and grow a company. Think going from zero to 10 million in 10 months...not in 10 years! Most entrepreneurs build businesses the wrong way....</p>\n<p><b>How to quickly sell a company when there is a limited buyer pool?</b>&nbsp;Strategies on how and when to sell the business for 6 or 7 figure sums. Perry will share how he quickly sold a Media company he acquired (when there were very few buyers) and how Perry maximized his exit.</p>\n<p>Additional real-world 'street-fighting' tactics that are&nbsp;<i><b>NOT taught in any MBA program&nbsp;</b></i>or global business schools. This is a highly transferrable skill set and after this workshop, you will have all the 'tools' to be able to go out and do this yourself.</p>\n<p><i>You will also leave the workshop with Contracts, Templates and Documents from actual deals done.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>You can then use these to replicate on your own deals.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>You will also be given a detailed list of&nbsp;<b>Perry's private 'non-bank' funders&nbsp;</b>(UK, US and Canada) and their direct contact&nbsp;details.&nbsp;</i>The value of this is priceless!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Have more questions?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Please contact Davide at:</b></p>\n<p><i>davide@perryanderson.global</i></p>\n<p><i><br></i></p>\n<p>PS:&nbsp;There is no sales pitch at this workshop and nothing is being sold to you - just pure knowledge exchange!</p>",

Welcome to MP North by Manhattan Partners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Join our group to keep up to date on events, from Dev to Testing to Diversity &amp; Inclusion</p>\n<p>We're an agency and consultancy based in the heart of Manchester on a mission to be on the forefront of changing the way people recruit. The founders, Julie Mombielova and John Gaskell joined forces to change the landscape of how recruitment currently operates. Many recruitment agencies still claim to be experts in their fields when they are not, therefore, under-delivering, demanding high rates and frustrating those who need a true transparent service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>So how do we differ, and why? One of our biggest USP's are our Partners, who are embedded experts at Manhattan Partners working alongside our specialist recruitment consultants. Our experts are involved from an end to end recruitment cycle, which has enabled us to be the first agency to disrupt the recruitment market like never before!</span> <br></p>\n<p><span>Check out our Recruitment, RPO, Consulting and outsourcing offerings :&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.manhattanpartners.co.uk/\">https://www.manhattanpartners.co.uk/</a></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

    "description": "<p>I am the house manager at a Co-Living space in Northern Quarter called Oppidan. I am in charge or arranging events for the tenants that suit their professional needs. I want to create an event that mixes different types of people from around the city. The days of working 9-5 are no longer always the norm and I would really love to bring different freelancers together on a weekly location.</p> \n<p>I really like the idea of a Freelance Friday where we can grow this event. To help with this I have approached Ziferblat to grow a network of independent workers at a 25% discount. The event will be open to the public – which could be students, freelancers and personal study/research. </p> \n<p>Ziferblat is very centrally located, right in the heart of the Northern Quarter so would be the perfect place to break out after the freelancing event to enjoy a beverage – this is the reason I have chosen the date of the event to take place on a Friday. </p> \n<p>The event itself would mean everyone gets support and advice from other people who freelance and can socialize with people from different background and working sectors.</p> \n<p>I could also negotiate more perks with Ziferblat to ensure repeat attendance for the event – things like 20% discount for the event rooms if they wish to use. Also providing free printing too which can be a hassle in the city. </p> \n<p>I want the event to be super relaxed for everyone in attendance so they can come in and just enjoy the space and the people around them.</p>",

    "description": "<p>*MFE as a group welcomes all women, including trans and non binary*</p><p><br /></p><p>The group has been founded to create a vibrant community of passionate females interested in meeting with motivated and exciting young professionals and expanding their network.</p><p>You will be able to network with successful local founders to share personal stories and lessons learned on the road to building our great companies.</p><p>You will be able to connect with outstanding female entrepreneurs, tap into a strong support network, form meaningful connections and gain inspiration from other like-minded females.</p><p>We aim to build a connected network of vibrant females to help fuel innovation, economic growth and prosperity at the local level.</p><p>The goals of this group are below:</p><p>1. Enable us, females, to learn about different industry focusses, share tips and advice for career development. So it is not simply acquiring business cards and adding names to your “LinkedIn” account – it is taking the time to get to know people in the areas in which you are interested or want to learn more about and staying in touch with them.</p><p>2. Initiate creating a series of events focused on professional development through speaker series, hands-on skill development workshops, and mentorship opportunities to help overcome the specific challenges faced by women.</p><p>3. Create a platform to practice soft skills in a casual and friendly setting. Most of us know our weaknesses, whether we need to be more organised or do a better job of meeting deadlines or simply prioritising in a more innovative way. Putting effort into improving those skills will make the attendees more marketable no matter what field they are in or would like to pursue.</p><p>We believe in making friends, not contacts. We believe in giving, not taking. We believe in helping others before helping ourselves.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Hello... Welcome... Bonjour... Hola, Ciao! <br> <br>Social Circle Meet Up is a group of professional individuals who develop friendships, share good times and enjoy life to the full. We have lots of members, but we are always looking for more to enjoy the fun times with. As the saying goes, ‘The more the merrier’. <br> <br>I know it may look like there is only myself on a Meet Up event, but that really isn’t the case. Our members book directly through our Social Circle Calendar ( <a href=\"https://www.social-circle.co.uk/calendar/\">https://www.social-circle.co.uk/calendar/</a> ). So when a booking on our Meet Up says FULLY BOOKED, it really is... not everyone is on Meet Up you know! Our walks regularly have 10-15+ walkers, as do our drinks nights, and our Murder Mystery Night is one of the most popular events on our Calendar. Our city breaks are legendary, and everything is thought of beforehand. Our city breaks are also available for members AND non-members of Social Circle. <br> <br>So please, try one of our FREE events on this Meet Up page. <br>It’s FREE, so what have you got to lose? <br> <br>Lindsey 😀</p>",
