If we are made aware of any incidents of racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, sexually inappropriate or religiously discriminatory language, behaviour or imagery, this may result in a ban from the group.</p>\n<p>If you have any issues or concerns relating to the code of conduct please contact one of the organisers either in person, though the Meetup page or via the email (<a href=\"mailto:infosechoppers@gmail.com\">infosechoppers@gmail.com</a>) or the slack group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Hoppers organisers:</b>&nbsp;<span>Catherine Chapman,&nbsp;</span><span>Saskia Coplans,&nbsp;</span><span>Gem Hill, Annie Mbako.</span></p>\n<p>If you have an issues at an event, meeting or workshop please speak to one of the organisers.</p>\n<p>Meetings and Workshops</p>\n<p>InfoSec Hoppers meetings and workshops usually are not sponsored.

Events are open to under 18’s, however we do not accept responsibility for minors so meetings and workshops are not appropriate for under 16’s unless accompanied by an adult.</p>\n<p>Meetings and talks are pitched at all technical levels, however workshops and CTFs will require some level of technical ability. All technical levels are welcome at the workshops and CTFs, we provide coaches for all abelites, but ask that members are respectful of their time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When attending meetings and workshops please respect the presenters.&nbsp;Please don’t talk amongst yourselves during their presentations, have your phones either muted or switched off and be aware that this is a group activity.</p>\n<p>We are guests of the venues we use, so please don’t tamper with fixtures, hardware, software or infrastructure, or generally take thinks such a food and drink without permission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All InfoSec Hoppers spaces are privately run and we withhold the right to remove and ultimately ban anyone who violates this code of conduct.</p>\n<br>",

We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all these areas. We can be found at www.owasp.org </p>\n<p>Local chapters provide a totally free meeting place for anyone interested in application security. So, come along to the Manchester chapter meetings if you would like to hear about, or share information with the community on how to ethically hack your own systems, how to defend your applications and how to build security into your applications. </p>\n<p>Chapter meetings also provide a great opportunity to meet like-minded people with similar interests. <br></p>\n<p>Chapter website: <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester</a> <br>Mailing list: <a href=\"https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Manchester\" class=\"linkified\">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Manchester</a> </p>\n<p>Although chapter meetings are provided free of charge, OWASP membership is encouraged.

We want to help create a great network of people who are there to learn from each other, share tips, learn about new tools, explore ideas and support each other in our aim to be great at what we do.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\n<p><span>We're based in Manchester and for 2017 we hope to have Meetups and workshops on the last Tuesday&nbsp;of every other month. There'll probably be Post-its, Sharpies, pizza, drinks, letting off some steam and having laughs. There'll be socials too and they'll involve less stationary. We'd love for you to join us.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\n<p>Not sure if there's something for you? Perhaps 'project manager' or 'delivery-something' or 'Scrum Master' isn't your role? Maybe not but the techniques to manage projects, people, relationships and budgets are still relevant. Whatever your job title, come along and join this fast growing community in the north.</p>\n<p>We are always looking for speakers, contact us via the meet-up.</p>\n<p>See you soon!</p>\n<p><span>Matt</span> <br></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattthornhilluk?lang=en\">@mattthornhilluk</a>&nbsp;</span> <br></p>",

Classes are made up of students from a wide range of nationalities and backgrounds, and even though many have had little experience with programming when they start, all gain skills that we hope can open up great opportunities for them. Across CodeYourFuture in Manchester, London and Glasgow, students have gained employment in companies like the Financial Times, STV and The Access Group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As of July 2019, we are in the process of getting ready for our third class in Manchester and are looking for people to join us to help us grow!</p>\n<p>We will be needing people to help teach our classes, which include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, SQL and React modules - but don’t worry if you do not have a tech background! <b>We are looking for people with skills to help with a wide range of tasks</b>, including outreach, admin, students’ personal development and soft skills education.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you would like to know more <b>please don’t hesitate to contact us</b> at <a href=\"mailto:manchester@codeyourfuture.io\">manchester@codeyourfuture.io</a></p>\n<p>Hope to see you soon!</p>\n<p>Lucy, Chris, Gabrielė &amp; the rest of the CYF Manchester team :-)</p>\n<p>You can read more about us here:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Forbes: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucysherriff/2019/06/18/codeyourfuture/\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucysherriff/2019/06/18/codeyourfuture/</a></p>\n<p>TechWorld: <a href=\"https://www.techworld.com/developers/how-code-your-future-are-helping-disadvantaged-break-into-tech-industry-3698464/\">https://www.techworld.com/developers/how-code-your-future-are-helping-disadvantaged-break-into-tech-industry-3698464/</a></p>\n<p>Wired: <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/codeyourfuture-refugee-coding-school\">http://www.wired.co.uk/article/codeyourfuture-refugee-coding-school</a></p>",

With this in mind, we’d prefer no recruiters take part with the intent to source clients and that vendors don’t do pitches at our events. </p>\n<p>Sponsors are of course welcome, but the notoriety and thanks are what we can offer. </p>\n<p><b>Code of conduct</b></p>\n<p>TL;DR: Be nice, understanding and helpful.</p>\n<p>1. I am an attendee at DevOps Manchester, learning from and sharing with other DevOps Manchester attendees in an effort to better myself and my industry. I co-create the experience with fellow attendees. I am prepared to give my energy, presence and sensitivity to creating the best possible experience for myself and others.</p>\n<p>2. I am coming to DevOps Manchester to interact with people. I understand that imagery and language which is suggestive or derogatory will offend and make people uncomfortable. I also understand that people may have boundaries and sensibilities different from my own. I will accept without question when informed that something is offensive or unacceptable in the context of the DevOps Manchester event.</p>\n<p>3. I will never intentionally harass or offend another attendee regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, size, race or religion and will not abide another attendee being harassed or offended. If I am aware that anyone is uncomfortable or unsafe, I will notify those giving offence and the DevOps Manchester event organizers.</p>\n<p>4. If I am offended or harassed, I will inform people around me who make me feel safe and the event organizers. If I feel safe, at my discretion, I will inform those giving offence of the specific actions with the hope that the other party is well-intentioned and ignorant, but I am under no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p>5. I understand that people are different and I attempt to be forgiving of others actions at the level of their sincere intent, but my priority is protecting my safety and the safety of others. I will act without hesitation or reservation until there is no question of the safety of all parties.</p>\n<p>6. I trust the DevOps Manchester organizers and attendees will co-create the best possible experience for everyone involved, as I will. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. If I or any other attendee violates the code of conduct, I expect the DevOps Manchester organizers to protect the attendees by direct action, including expelling those in violation and contacting the proper authorities if required.</p>\n<p><b>Talk guidelines</b></p>\n<p>Talks that tell a story are often the most popular, so please share your experiences and encourage discussion. </p>\n<p>Further information can be found on: <br> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/\">http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devopsmanc\"> <br> </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devopsmanc\">https://twitter.com/devopsmanc</a> <br> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Hello... Welcome... Bonjour... Hola, Ciao! <br> <br>Social Circle Meet Up is a group of professional individuals who develop friendships, share good times and enjoy life to the full. We have lots of members, but we are always looking for more to enjoy the fun times with. As the saying goes, ‘The more the merrier’. <br> <br>I know it may look like there is only myself on a Meet Up event, but that really isn’t the case. Our members book directly through our Social Circle Calendar ( <a href=\"https://www.social-circle.co.uk/calendar/\">https://www.social-circle.co.uk/calendar/</a> ). So when a booking on our Meet Up says FULLY BOOKED, it really is... not everyone is on Meet Up you know! Our walks regularly have 10-15+ walkers, as do our drinks nights, and our Murder Mystery Night is one of the most popular events on our Calendar. Our city breaks are legendary, and everything is thought of beforehand. Our city breaks are also available for members AND non-members of Social Circle. <br> <br>So please, try one of our FREE events on this Meet Up page. <br>It’s FREE, so what have you got to lose? <br> <br>Lindsey 😀</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>We meet on the 2nd Thursday of each month!</b> Event pages are created about 3-4 weeks in advance but future dates are scheduled on the <a href=\"https://technw.uk/calendar.html\">technwuk calendar</a>. <br></p>\n<p>HER+Data MCR is a Meetup group which brings together anyone who identifies as a woman and has a connection to data - whether they work with data, would like to work with data, and/or simply have an interest in data! The scope is intended to be broad to include as many women within STEM as possible while also maintaining a focus on the topic of data - we talk data science, analytics, research, visualisation, software, applications and experiences women share working in male dominated environments. We have members whose backgrounds range from academia to industry, students to CEOs, neuroscientists to idea implementers. We meet once a month (on the 2nd Thursday), provide ample time for networking, and showcase 2-4 women in data speakers who talk about their career paths, role models, challenges faced and data projects that they work on. We also conduct masterclasses a few times each year on topics such as CV writing, interviewing techniques and salary negotiation to empower women to progress in data roles. <br></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://herplusdata.org/\">HER+Data</a> is a space where everyone can share their stories and develop. We're volunteer driven so we keep our events simple and informal. There will be great content, laughter and a room full of data women from various backgrounds. So come along, ask questions, and get inspired! And if there are specific topics that you would like to see discussed then please let us know. We are always happy to explore new ideas and new collaborations. HER+Data was originally founded in Dublin, Ireland as XX+Data by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenchurch\">Karen Church</a> and the Manchester chapter was established by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachaelevelyn\">Rachael Ainsworth</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much to <a href=\"https://www.evolutionjobs.com/uk/\">Evolution Recruitment Solutions</a> for sponsoring our events! Evolution delivers IT and tech recruitment solutions for niche and volume contingent, retained search, RPO and contract assignments. Our specialist recruitment consultants partner with their clients to provide the best quality candidates for hard-to-fill roles. Using customer intelligence from the relationships we’ve developed, augmented with data from social media, events, networking, and advertisement responses, provides us with a detailed profile of the IT professionals our clients need. Evolution is different because we don’t just recruit in the IT and tech sectors, we are actively and consistently involved in the industries – including our involvement with HER + Data. We are committed to promoting equality and diversity within the IT and tech industries. 2019 statistics show that women make up only one-in-six tech specialists in the UK, Evolution is committed to improving these numbers and highlighting the importance of women working in IT and tech. <br></p>\n<p>We would also love to thank the <a href=\"https://software.ac.uk/\">Software Sustainability Institute</a> for sponsoring the cost of our Meetup page and to <a href=\"http://stickermule.com/supports/herdatamcr19-sponsorship\">Sticker Mule</a> for sponsoring our stickers! <br></p>\n<p>By joining our community, you are agree to abide by our <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/HER-Data-MCR/pages/28013678/Code_of_Conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a>. <br></p>",

This will offer a great opportunity for both developers with or without experience in this stack. The format of the meetup may differ each month, to give both developers mentioned previously a chance to learn new things and challenge themselves.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for improvements or new topics are always welcomed!</p>\n<p>Should you have something interesting to talk about, either from a theoretical point of view or a demo to showcase, this will be your chance! Get in touch with the organiser for more details.</p>\n<p>Thanks and I hope you will all be joining us, <br>Emanuell &amp; the MoneySuperMarket team</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mission: To build a strong community to support, mentor and promote leadership and careers for women in technology in the North of the UK. Women in tech is a never-ending conversation. Does it swirl around a set of anxieties we share in our underrepresented gender — anxieties we might not even understand? More than ever, women in technology need to support each other. Encourage each other. Be each other’s cheerleaders, boosters and sponsors. Pipeline problems aren’t solved at the top, remember, but at the bottom. There’s a massive gender gap in the tech sector and it’s a fact we need to be aware of. <br>- The fact that women are under-represented – only 1 in 10 IT workers in the IT industry are women <br>- The fact that women are paid 16% less than their male counterparts doing the same job But is being aware enough? Absolutely NOT. However, being aware is definitely a starting point for us to change the face of technology. We want you all to think about what we, as a group and as individuals can do to eliminate this gap. Ambitions: <br>- Contribute to change the gender imbalance in the IT industry for the future <br>- Find professional fulfilment <br>- Inspire and persuade others to step up, achieve more, reach higher</p>\n<p> <br>We are here to: Connect the professional, creative, innovative and hard-working women to achieve their full potential</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<br>",

    "description": "<p>Bringing #YouEqualTech to the North</p>\n<p>Spinks started the conversation on Diversity in Tech when we launched the tech industry’s first Women in Tech Survey, in partnership with Computer Weekly. Since then the conversation has evolved, moving away from diversity seen only through a gender lens; addressing the need for diverse tech teams and inclusive work places where people feel they fully belong. </p>\n<p>We believe in the power of community – #YouEqualTech started 2 years ago in London and is slowly becoming a leading community making change happen through their meetups and network. With over 3000 people in the group we felt it was time to take #YouEqualTech to the North and expand the reach and impact. </p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is to bring together people in technology, to continue this incredibly important conversation. Change doesn’t start top down, it has to happen at every level across every function. Community led initiatives are incredibly effective at having wide reaching results and helping to pave the way through learning, talking and hearing what about works/doesn’t work also having the opportunity to hear and see role models from under-represented groups in tech.</p>\n<p><span>The purpose of this meetup is to connect the technology and digital industry to the outside world!</span> <br></p>\n<p>We aim to:</p>\n<p>• Dispel myths and incorrect perceptions of what it’s like to work in tech and digital.</p>\n<p>• Educate and inform the various routes into technology and digital career</p>\n<p>• Work towards gender diversity in tech</p>\n<p>• Close the skills gap!</p>\n<p>Join this group if:</p>\n<p>• You work in technology or digital and are interested in working towards an inclusive and diverse industry</p>\n<p>• You do not work in a technical role but are interested in a possible career within the industry</p>\n<p>We will be holding regular meet up events and each one will aim to provide practical advice on driving diversity within the technology industry.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in being a speaker at one of our events please get in touch with lara.hanson@wearespinks.com&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also share ideas, initiatives and tips on our #YetNorth <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12211220/\">LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s super important to us that everyone feels welcome at #YETNorth events, so please familiarise yourselves with our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/You-Equal-Tech-North/pages/28531977/Code_of_Conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a><span>.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p>The plan is to meet fortnightly to discuss and improve our understanding of design patterns. Initially we'll follow the 23 week guide covering the Gang of Four Design Patterns laid out by Joshua Kerievsky here - <a href=\"https://www.industriallogic.com/papers/learning.html\">https://www.industriallogic.com/papers/learning.html</a></p>\n<p>The idea is that all attendees learn the pattern before the group meet, then during the meeting they consider various questions about the pattern. In doing so we'll benefit from the wisdom of the crowd and hopefully improve our understanding.</p>\n<p><span>Please note an in depth knowledge of patterns isn't required and all skill levels are welcome!&nbsp; A diverse range of perspectives is encouraged, however we'd recommend that attendees have studied the pattern that'll be discussed that week.</span></p>\n<p>Food and drink provided. 🙌</p>",

By using a kata format, you're able to be introduced to something new and then really get stuck in with it - all you need to do is bring your laptop.</p> \n<p>The introduction to the new technologies is provided by the best possible speakers. Remaining language agnostic, so you can interact with the new tech however you develop, we offer a fair and open opportunity for those of all skill sets to experience something new, brush up on skills, or even learn a new approach from those around you.</p> \n<p>This isn't designed to be a super serious, heads down event. The flow is loose, collaboration is encouraged, as long as you feel like you've gained new knowledge then we're happy.</p>",
