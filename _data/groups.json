    "description": "<p>IT Infrastructure and the move to cloud services are the essential backbone of all effective businesses. MIG (Manchester Infrastructure Group) was created so that professionals in this area can get to together and share ideas and thoughts on this ever evolving space!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This meet up is designed to be a learning platform&nbsp;to upskill the community, alongside being a networking opportunity for individuals who want to create a community outside of work; to bounce ideas, talk about the challenges they are facing, make friends&nbsp;and&nbsp;much&nbsp;more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is a place where the tech community can come to listen, learn, explore and connect. These events take place every month and bring some of the industry’s leading experts to the meetups to talk about their experience. These meet ups also provide a stage for those with something to share, or a seat for those with a hunger to learn and progress.&nbsp;You will take away hints and tips that you can take back to your teams, then tell us at the next meetup if it was successful.&nbsp;All this whilst&nbsp;making&nbsp;some friends along the way over Pizza and beer&nbsp;and/or virtually!</p>\n<p><br>We&nbsp;are always on the lookout for people to facilitate or present sessions, as well as businesses who wish to host - so if you are interested, get in touch!</p>",

By using our interactive format, you're able to be introduced to something new and then really get stuck in with it.</p>\n<p>The introduction to the new technologies is provided by the best possible speakers. We're very much open to people of all experience from beginner to expert as we offer a fair and open opportunity for those of all skill sets to experience something new, brush up on skills, or even learn a new approach from those around you.</p>\n<p>This isn't designed to be a super serious, heads down event. The flow is loose, collaboration is encouraged, as long as you feel like you've gained new knowledge then we're happy.</p>",

We all know that data has the potential to transform how projects, programmes and portfolios are delivered, but practical implementation constraints often prevent the full value from being realised. This meetup will explore some of the challenges at the intersection of data analysis and project, programme and portfolio management and discuss how practitioners are working to resolve them, underpinned by real world examples.</p> \n<p>We'll also explore how machine learning and AI can help to resolve some of the challenges at the intersection of project / programme management and big data.</p> \n<p>The NW Project Data Analytics Meetup expands the hugely successful London Project Data Analytics community across the country. </p> \n<p>Please check out our community site at <a href=\"http://projectdataanalytics.uk\" class=\"linkified\">http://projectdataanalytics.uk</a> . We are in the process of refreshing it but it will have details of events, community news, videos, slides, blogs and a series of resources on how to get started in project data analytics.</p>",

Given what's going on in the world right now, we have taken the decision to bring forward our plan to introduce Deliver Sessions in the Ether, an online meetup which we hope will reach a further audience as well as our regulars in Manchester!</p> \n<p>This event is using the <b>in the Ether</b> format, for more info or to find out how to run your own meet-up in the Ether please see <a href=\"http://intheether.xyz\">intheether.xyz</a></p> \n<p>We want to help create a great network of people who are there to learn from each other, share tips, learn about new tools, explore ideas and support each other in our aim to be great at what we do.</p> \n<p>Not sure if there's something for you? Perhaps 'project manager' or 'delivery-something' or 'Scrum Master' isn't your role? Maybe not but the techniques to manage projects, people, relationships and budgets are still relevant.

I've met so many bright, inspiring women working in the advertising industry here in Manchester, that I wanted to create a casual occasion for us to get together and hear from inspiring guest speakers, chat about work we love, work we don't, and most importantly, get to know each other over a drink or two!<br>So whether you're a suit or a creative, a student looking to break into the industry or an old hand, come along with an open mind, and ambition so vertical you could use it as a barge pole. Looking forward to meeting you!</p>",

We love sharing technical and marketing expertise to help others achieve what they intend through WordPress.</p>\n<p>We meet once per month, on the third Wednesday, in Manchester's Northern Quarter. We meet as a whole group, run breakout sessions to resolve small or complex problems to keep you moving, and encourage topical guest speakers. We welcome all interest whether you are a keen programmer, entrepreneur or hobby blogger wanting to maximise the potential of your WordPress blog.</p>\n<p>You'll find a route to continued discussion and support within the community in our Google group -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/manchester-wordpress-user-group\">https://groups.google.com/d/forum/manchester-wordpress-user-group</a>. <strong>Please post questions on the google group rather than on Meetup</strong>.</p>\n<p>All levels of experience welcome!

    "description": "<p><span>DevOps Manchester is a community of like-minded individuals that get together and talk about DevOps, whether it’s technical or cultural and regardless of industry.</span><br></p>\n<p>The aim is to have 4 - 6 meetups per year with a flexible format of two 30 - 45 minutes talks, one technical and one not; Followed by the possibility of some lightning talks, panels, roundtables and networking time. </p>\n<p>Food and drink are provided, usually by the host or a sponsor.</p>\n<p><b>What we are not about</b></p>\n<p>Recruitment, vendor pitches &amp; knowledge declaration. </p>\n<p>The group will be a safe place to discuss experiences and ideas. With this in mind, we’d prefer no recruiters take part with the intent to source clients and that vendors don’t do pitches at our events. </p>\n<p>Sponsors are of course welcome, but the notoriety and thanks are what we can offer. </p>\n<p><b>Code of conduct</b></p>\n<p>TL;DR: Be nice, understanding and helpful.</p>\n<p>1. I am an attendee at DevOps Manchester, learning from and sharing with other DevOps Manchester attendees in an effort to better myself and my industry. I co-create the experience with fellow attendees. I am prepared to give my energy, presence and sensitivity to creating the best possible experience for myself and others.</p>\n<p>2. I am coming to DevOps Manchester to interact with people. I understand that imagery and language which is suggestive or derogatory will offend and make people uncomfortable. I also understand that people may have boundaries and sensibilities different from my own. I will accept without question when informed that something is offensive or unacceptable in the context of the DevOps Manchester event.</p>\n<p>3. I will never intentionally harass or offend another attendee regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, size, race or religion and will not abide another attendee being harassed or offended. If I am aware that anyone is uncomfortable or unsafe, I will notify those giving offence and the DevOps Manchester event organizers.</p>\n<p>4. If I am offended or harassed, I will inform people around me who make me feel safe and the event organizers. If I feel safe, at my discretion, I will inform those giving offence of the specific actions with the hope that the other party is well-intentioned and ignorant, but I am under no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p>5. I understand that people are different and I attempt to be forgiving of others actions at the level of their sincere intent, but my priority is protecting my safety and the safety of others. I will act without hesitation or reservation until there is no question of the safety of all parties.</p>\n<p>6. I trust the DevOps Manchester organizers and attendees will co-create the best possible experience for everyone involved, as I will. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. If I or any other attendee violates the code of conduct, I expect the DevOps Manchester organizers to protect the attendees by direct action, including expelling those in violation and contacting the proper authorities if required.</p>\n<p><b>Talk guidelines</b></p>\n<p>Talks that tell a story are often the most popular, so please share your experiences and encourage discussion. </p>\n<p>Further information can be found on: <br> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/\">http://www.devopsmanchester.co.uk/</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devopsmanc\"> <br> </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devopsmanc\">https://twitter.com/devopsmanc</a> <br> </p>",

    "description": "<p><b>HER+Data MCR (\"Her plus Data Manchester\") is a community working to connect, inspire, support and empower the NW UK’s Women in Data! </b>We meet on the 2nd Thursday of each month. Event pages are created about 3-4 weeks in advance but future dates are scheduled on the <a href=\"https://technw.uk/calendar.html\">technwuk calendar</a>. <br></p>\n<p>HER+Data MCR is a Meetup group which brings together anyone who identifies as a woman and has a connection to data - whether they work with data, would like to work with data, and/or simply have an interest in data! The scope is intended to be broad to include as many women within STEM as possible while also maintaining a focus on the topic of data - we talk data science, analytics, research, visualisation, software, applications and experiences women share working in male dominated environments. We have members whose backgrounds range from academia to industry, students to CEOs, neuroscientists to idea implementers. We meet once a month (on the 2nd Thursday), provide ample time for networking, and showcase 2-4 women in data speakers who talk about their career paths, role models, challenges faced and data projects that they work on. We also conduct masterclasses a few times each year on topics such as CV writing, interviewing techniques and salary negotiation to empower women to progress in data roles. <br></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://herplusdata.org/\">HER+Data</a> is a space where everyone can share their stories and develop. We're volunteer driven so we keep our events simple and informal. There will be great content, laughter and a room full of data women from various backgrounds. So come along, ask questions, and get inspired! And if there are specific topics that you would like to see discussed then please let us know. We are always happy to explore new ideas and new collaborations. HER+Data was originally founded in Dublin, Ireland as XX+Data by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenchurch\">Karen Church</a> and the Manchester chapter was established by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachaelevelyn\">Rachael Ainsworth</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much to <a href=\"https://www.evolutionjobs.com/uk/\">Evolution Recruitment Solutions</a> for sponsoring our events! Evolution delivers IT and tech recruitment solutions for niche and volume contingent, retained search, RPO and contract assignments. Our specialist recruitment consultants partner with their clients to provide the best quality candidates for hard-to-fill roles. Using customer intelligence from the relationships we’ve developed, augmented with data from social media, events, networking, and advertisement responses, provides us with a detailed profile of the IT professionals our clients need. Evolution is different because we don’t just recruit in the IT and tech sectors, we are actively and consistently involved in the industries – including our involvement with HER + Data. We are committed to promoting equality and diversity within the IT and tech industries. 2019 statistics show that women make up only one-in-six tech specialists in the UK, Evolution is committed to improving these numbers and highlighting the importance of women working in IT and tech. <br></p>\n<p>We would also love to thank the <a href=\"https://software.ac.uk/\">Software Sustainability Institute</a> for sponsoring the cost of our Meetup page and to <a href=\"http://stickermule.com/supports/herdatamcr19-sponsorship\">Sticker Mule</a> for sponsoring our stickers! <br></p>\n<p>By joining our community, you are agree to abide by our <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/HER-Data-MCR/pages/28013678/Code_of_Conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a>. <br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Mission: To build a strong community to support, mentor and promote leadership and careers for women in technology in the North of the UK. Women in tech is a never-ending conversation. Does it swirl around a set of anxieties we share in our underrepresented gender — anxieties we might not even understand? More than ever, women in technology need to support each other. Encourage each other. Be each other’s cheerleaders, boosters and sponsors. Pipeline problems aren’t solved at the top, remember, but at the bottom. There’s a massive gender gap in the tech sector and it’s a fact we need to be aware of. <br>- The fact that women are under-represented – only 1 in 10 IT workers in the IT industry are women <br>- The fact that women are paid 16% less than their male counterparts doing the same job But is being aware enough? Absolutely NOT. However, being aware is definitely a starting point for us to change the face of technology. We want you all to think about what we, as a group and as individuals can do to eliminate this gap. Ambitions: <br>- Contribute to change the gender imbalance in the IT industry for the future <br>- Find professional fulfilment <br>- Inspire and persuade others to step up, achieve more, reach higher</p>\n<p> <br>We are here to: Connect the professional, creative, innovative and hard-working women to achieve their full potential</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<br>",

    "description": "<p>Bringing #YouEqualTech to the North</p>\n<p>Spinks started the conversation on Diversity in Tech when we launched the tech industry’s first Women in Tech Survey, in partnership with Computer Weekly. Since then the conversation has evolved, moving away from diversity seen only through a gender lens; addressing the need for diverse tech teams and inclusive work places where people feel they fully belong. </p>\n<p>We believe in the power of community – #YouEqualTech started 2 years ago in London and is slowly becoming a leading community making change happen through their meetups and network. With over 3000 people in the group we felt it was time to take #YouEqualTech to the North and expand the reach and impact. </p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is to bring together people in technology, to continue this incredibly important conversation. Change doesn’t start top down, it has to happen at every level across every function. Community led initiatives are incredibly effective at having wide reaching results and helping to pave the way through learning, talking and hearing what about works/doesn’t work also having the opportunity to hear and see role models from under-represented groups in tech.</p>\n<p><span>The purpose of this meetup is to connect the technology and digital industry to the outside world!</span> <br></p>\n<p>We aim to:</p>\n<p>• Dispel myths and incorrect perceptions of what it’s like to work in tech and digital.</p>\n<p>• Educate and inform the various routes into technology and digital career</p>\n<p>• Work towards gender diversity in tech</p>\n<p>• Close the skills gap!</p>\n<p>Join this group if:</p>\n<p>• You work in technology or digital and are interested in working towards an inclusive and diverse industry</p>\n<p>• You do not work in a technical role but are interested in a possible career within the industry</p>\n<p>We will be holding regular meet up events and each one will aim to provide practical advice on driving diversity within the technology industry.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in being a speaker at one of our events please get in touch with lara.hanson@wearespinks.com&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also share ideas, initiatives and tips on our #YetNorth <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12211220/\">LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s super important to us that everyone feels welcome at #YETNorth events, so please familiarise yourselves with our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/You-Equal-Tech-North/pages/28531977/Code_of_Conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a><span>.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p>Hello... Welcome... Bonjour... Hola, Ciao! <br> <br>Social Circle Meet Up is a group of professional individuals who develop friendships, share good times and enjoy life to the full. We have lots of members, but we are always looking for more to enjoy the fun times with. As the saying goes, ‘The more the merrier’. <br> <br>I know it may look like there is only myself on a Meet Up event, but that really isn’t the case. Our members book directly through our Social Circle Calendar ( <a href=\"https://www.social-circle.co.uk/calendar/\">https://www.social-circle.co.uk/calendar/</a> ). So when a booking on our Meet Up says FULLY BOOKED, it really is... not everyone is on Meet Up you know! Our walks regularly have 10-15+ walkers, as do our drinks nights, and our Murder Mystery Night is one of the most popular events on our Calendar. Our city breaks are legendary, and everything is thought of beforehand. Our city breaks are also available for members AND non-members of Social Circle. <br> <br>So please, try one of our FREE events on this Meet Up page. <br>It’s FREE, so what have you got to lose? <br> <br>Lindsey 😀</p>",

    "description": "<p>CodeUp is a learner led monthly meetup for adults learning how to code. You tell us what you need support with, and we will do our best to help. With professional developers on hand to help, don't struggle alone, let us help you develop your skills, for free!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our passion is learning. as we reach adulthood, attending a learning environment so often comes at a cost. any cost is a barrier. We believe in providing the opportunity for adults to learn how to create great digital experiences; whether that’s writing an app for a smartphone or creating a website for fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly, we provide that opportunity without the barriers; We don’t sell you anything and we won't charge you anything. We’ll give you a way to learn digital skills in a fun, friendly and inclusive environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All we ask is to bring along your enthusiasm a drive to learn something new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have any suggestions on what you would like to see in these sessions, or if you would like to join us as a mentor, please use the discussion section and an organiser will get back to you :)</p>",
